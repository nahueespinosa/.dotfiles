# Dotfiles [![CI](https://github.com/nahueespinosa/.dotfiles/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nahueespinosa/.dotfiles/actions/workflows/build.yml)

After cloning this repo, run install to automatically set up the development environment. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times.

Dotfiles uses [Dotbot][dotbot] for installation.

Feel free to take any parts of my configuration as inspiration but keep in mind that these settings are optimal for my use case.
As Anish Athalye, creator of dotbot, [puts it](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/):

> If certain configurations worked for everybody, those settings would have been built into programs as defaults. Blindly cloning someone elseâ€™s dotfiles, especially without having an understanding of how everything works, is **not** the optimal approach.
