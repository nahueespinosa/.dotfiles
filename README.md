# Dotfiles [![CI](https://github.com/nahueespinosa/.dotfiles/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nahueespinosa/.dotfiles/actions/workflows/build.yml)

These are the configuration files I like to use for command-line programs. After cloning this repo, run `install` to automatically set up the development environment.

I **do not** recommend installing this unless you're willing to overwrite the dotfiles on your machine. However, feel free to take any ideas or reach out with recommendations for my setup.
